The problem being solved in these projects:
The main problem was designing and implementing a course planner system. This system needed to load course data from a file, store it in various data structures, and provide functionality to display course information and lists of courses in alphanumeric order.
Approach to the problem and importance of data structures:
The approach involved implementing the system using different data structures: vector, hash table, and binary search tree (BST). This demonstrates the importance of understanding data structures, as each has its own strengths and weaknesses:


Vectors are simple and efficient for small datasets, but may be slower for large datasets when searching.
Hash tables offer fast average-case lookup times but can have poor worst-case performance due to collisions.
BSTs provide a balance between search efficiency and ordered traversal, but can become unbalanced.

Understanding these characteristics allows you to choose the most appropriate structure for specific use cases.

Roadblocks:

Implementing efficient sorting algorithms for the vector-based approach.
Handling hash collisions in the hash table implementation.
Balancing the BST to maintain optimal performance.

I overcame these challenges through careful algorithm design and implementation.

This project expanded my approach to software design by:
Emphasizing the importance of choosing appropriate data structures.
Demonstrating how to implement the same functionality using different underlying structures.
Encouraging analysis of time complexity for different operations.



The project evolved my program writing skills by:
Using object-oriented design (e.g., the Course class) to encapsulate data and behavior.
Implementing modular functions for specific tasks (e.g., loadDataStructure, printCourseList).
Providing clear comments and using meaningful variable names.
Creating a flexible design that allows easy switching between data structures.
Using error handling to make the program more robust.
